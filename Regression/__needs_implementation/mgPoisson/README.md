# Tests of the MGpoisson updater

Due to the complexity of this updater, and the numerous components within it, it is useful to have separate regression tests for various individual parts, as well as for the whole solver.

These tests consist of:

- rt-mgPoisson-FEM-basisTranslate-1D.lua 
- rt-mgPoisson-FEM-basisTranslate-2D.lua
- rt-mgPoisson-FEM-intergrid-1D.lua
- rt-mgPoisson-FEM-intergrid-2D.lua
- rt-mgPoisson-FEM-relax-1D.lua
- rt-mgPoisson-FEM-relax-2D.lua
- rt-mgPoisson-FEM-norm-1D.lua
- rt-mgPoisson-FEM-norm-2D.lua

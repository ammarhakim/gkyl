# About

This is the Gkeyll code. The name is pronounced as in the book "The
Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" which is required reading for
all members of the Gkeyll Team. Gkeyll is written in a combination of
LuaJIT and C++.  Gkeyll is developed at Princeton Plasma Physics
Laboratory (PPPL) and is copyrighted 2016-2020 by Ammar Hakim and the
Gkeyll Team.

Documentation for the code is available at http://gkeyll.rtfd.io.

# License

**Gkeyll can be used freely for research at universities, national
laboratories and other research institutions. 
If you want to use Gkeyll in a commercial environment,
please ask us first.**

We follow an *open-source but closed development model*. Even though
read access to the code is available to everyone, write access to the
source-code repository is restricted to those who need to modify the
code. In practice, this means researchers at PPPL and our partner
institutions. In particular, this means that for write access you
either need to have jointly funded projects or jointly supervised
graduate students or postdocs with Princeton University/PPPL.

In general, we allow users to "fork" the code to make their own
modifications. However, we would appreciate if you would work with us
to merge your features back into the main-line (if those features are
useful to the larger Gkeyll team). You can submit a "pull request" and
we will try our best to merge your changes into the
mainline. Contributed code should compile and have sufficient
unit/regression tests.

# Ghost, Ghouls and Zombies

The Grand CEO of Gkeyll has proclaimed that all code shall be (a)
comprehensible, (b) tested with regression and/or unit tests, and (c)
used *somewhere*. To facilitate this we shall define:

- **Ghost** is code that does not have any regression and/or unit
  tests. Just like their non-virtual cousins such ghost code will not
  be deemed to exist.

- **Ghoul** is code that is completely incomprehensible, often even to
  the original author. Much of the CAS-generated kernels (and some
  code written by the Grand CEO Himself) are ghouls.
  
- **Zombie** is code that is not used anywhere and no one knows why it
  exists and if deleting it is safe.
  
The goal is to avoid ghost, ghouls and zombies as much as possible
using excellent software practices.

# About

This is the Gkyl code. The name is pronounced as in the book "The
Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". Gkyl is written in a
combination of LuaJIT and C++. The goal is to use C++ for
time-critical parts while writing the higher-level parts in
LuaJIT. Gkyl is developed at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory
(PPPL) and is copyrighted 2016-present by Ammar Hakim.

Documentation for the code is available at http://gkyl.rtfd.io.

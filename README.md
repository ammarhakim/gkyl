# About

This is the Gkeyll code. The name is pronounced as in the book "The
Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". Gkeyll is written in a
combination of LuaJIT and C++.  Gkeyll is developed at Princeton Plasma
Physics Laboratory (PPPL) and is copyrighted 2016-2019 by Ammar Hakim.

Documentation for the code is available at http://gkeyll.rtfd.io.

# License

**Gkeyll can be used freely for research at universities, national
laboratories and other research institutions. 
If you want to use Gkeyll in a commercial environment,
please ask us first.**

We follow an *open-source but closed development model*. Even though
read access to the code is available to everyone, write access to the
source-code repository is restricted to those who need to modify the
code. In practice, this means researchers at PPPL and our partner
institutions. In particular, this means that for write access you
either need to have jointly funded projects or jointly supervised
graduate students or postdocs with Princeton University/PPPL.

In general, we allow users to "fork" the code to make their own
modifications. However, we would appreciate if you would work with us
to merge your features back into the main-line (if those features are
useful to the larger Gkeyll team). You can submit a "pull request" and
we will try our best to merge your changes into the
mainline. Contributed code should compile and have sufficient
unit/regression tests.
